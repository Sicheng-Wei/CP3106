#### 1d_wave
​	Reconstruction of a wave function, based on **Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT)**.

​	The DCT is better than DFT for matrix manipulation, thus elements of DFT are in complex plane, make it hard for optimization functions to handle.



#### 2d_image

​	Reconstruction of a small grayscale image, also based on **DCT**.
